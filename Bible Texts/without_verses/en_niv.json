His disciples came to him,<br> and he began to teach them. He said:<br> \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.<br> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.<br> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.<br> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.<br> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.<br> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.<br> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br> \u201cBlessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.<br> Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.<br> \u201cYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.<br> \u201cYou are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.<br> Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.<br> In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. <b>Glory be to God forever!</b>", "luke_9,10-17": " When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,<br> but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.<br> Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, \u201cSend the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.\u201d<br> He replied, \u201cYou give them something to eat.\u201d They answered, \u201cWe have only five loaves of bread and two fish\u2014unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.\u201d<br> (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, \u201cHave them sit down in groups of about fifty each.\u201d<br> The disciples did so, and everyone sat down.<br> Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people.<br> They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. <b>Glory be to God forever!</b>", "luke_4,38-41": " Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon\u2019s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.<br> So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.<br> At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.<br> Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, \u201cYou are the Son of God!\u201d But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah. <b>Glory be to God forever!</b>", "luke_2,25-32": " Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout.
