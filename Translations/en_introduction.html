<p><b>Praying the Psalms in the early church</b></p><p>Praying the Psalms is a form of worship dating back to the beginnings of the Christian faith. It ties in with the worship of the Jews. The first followers of Jesus were praying in the temple in the same manner as the Jews.</p><p>The famous Jewish historian Philo reported that Jesus used to pray with his disciples in the temple Psalms. In Acts we find evidence of the continuation of this practice in the time of the apostles.</p><p><i>Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour, for the prayer time.</i>(Acts 3: 1)</p><p><i>The next day, as they went on their journey, and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour.</i>(Acts 10, 9)</p><p><i>Cornelius said, Four days ago at this time I was praying at the ninth hour in my house. And behold, a man stood before me in bright robe.</i>(Acts 10, 20)</p><p>The early church continued this tradition of psalm prayer at certain times of the day continued and developed them further.</p><p><b>The prayer of the Psalms in the life of the early Fathers</b></p><p>The early fathers of the church was the Book of Psalms as inspired by the Holy Spirit prayer book that God has given to His people in the Old and New Testaments alike. Praying the Psalms meets the worshipers after their conviction with the anointing of worship. They prayed the Psalms so every day and looked at it as a basis, should begin every worship.</p><p><b>The prayer of the Psalms as manna for the mind</b></p><p>Although we strive to worship with all my heart, we pray but often only with the mind and will not in the spirit. Thus resulting in the worship of the spirit and mind and spirit come, the spirit needs its special food that sustains him and enabled. The Book of Psalms is this food.</p><p>The Psalms were therefore often referred to by the early Fathers of the Church as the spiritual manna of the new Israel, just as ancient Israel for 40 years received manna in the wilderness. This was the daily food, not only for the body but also for the mind. As long as the people of Israel fed by manna, it never lost a battle. Conversely bestowed those who were tired of manna and thought about returning to Egypt, the people big problems. They had never tasted the spiritual dimension of Manna.</p><p>Therefore, the early Fathers of the Church said: "Just as the people of Israel day for the same food day he took with him to get physically and mentally, we have to feed us every day with our spiritual manna."</p><p>Some may think that the daily repetition of Psalms degenerates into boring routine. The early Fathers of the Church considered, however, that God that fed exclusively with manna Israel every day for 40 years. He did not change the menu! Not the words that we speak, make prayer routine. What counts is the spirit in which they are spoken. to pray the psalms every day allows the faithful to worship with the Word of God. This is the food for the mind.</p><p>However, according to the early Fathers not be enough of the church to pray only the Psalms. The Psalms are the introduction, the beginning and then to worship in spirit and to pray. The psalms kindles the spirit of the petitioner so that he can pray their own prayers, whether prayers, intercessions or other prayers. Through the psalms of prayer comes to mind. This can happen with God and prophetic impressions received without confused by their own feelings or thoughts or become mired in a real dialogue. The psalms they understood so as sanctifying preparation, the free, prophetic prayer, prayer with "unveiled face" joins.</p><p><i>But we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, and we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory of the Lord who is the Spirit.</i>(2 Cor 3, 18)</p><p>The purpose of the free prayer is it to look the face of God, that we may be transformed into His image. But that will only happen if our spirit is strengthened and grows.</p><p><b>The prayer of the psalms helps us to a disciplined spiritual life</b></p><p>This spiritual preparation for the free prayer takes time and diligence. If someone really has a hunger for the glory of God and is ready to tread the path of spiritual discipline humble and resistant, are entrusted to all the riches of heaven. The Lord wants to give us all that He has:<i>And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom the Lord will set over his household, to give it the metered meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom when he comes find his Lord, so doing! In truth I say to you that he will set him over all his belongings.</i>(Lukas 12, 42–44)</p><p><b>The prayer of the Psalms has a cleansing effect</b></p><p>We often struggle with the distinction of things and to correct instruction and guidance through the Spirit. This is because we often go from one day to the next, without shaking off the dust of the past day.</p><p>The Psalms are like a spiritual shower that cleanses the mind and soul of the activities of the flesh and the filth of the world, one day creeps over into it. to read the word of God and praying, thinking and soul clears. The mind is refreshed and ready to communicate with God and to be a more sensitive receiver.</p><p><b>The prayer of the Psalms strengthens the weak soul</b></p><p>By the fall, the human soul has become unstable. As a result, you may be happy and in peace, but as soon as something negative or sad happens or is said, one is defeated. It oscillates between encouragement and discouragement. We must gird ourselves and treat these wobbly soul, for its instability affects the mind. You can cut us off from the sanctifying power of the Spirit. It is to enable our responsibility to excavate the riverbed to the flow of sanctifying current. This also is done by praying the Psalms.</p><p>The prostration during prayer Psalm helps the soul girded, awake and stay alert. All components of our humanity (soul, mind, spirit and body) will be used in prayer.<i>I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service.</i>(Römer 12, 1)</p><p><b>Praying the Psalms tears the veil</b></p><p>True prayer is a changing experience. Every time we encounter His presence and look at him with undisguised (entschleiertem) face, we should be transformed (2 Cor 3, 18). we experience every time this transformation when we come into His presence? That this often does not happen, the ever our inner eye is because of the veil that covered. One of the main effects of the psalm prayer is to tear this veil over again.</p><p><b>Praying the Psalms is liturgical prayer</b></p><p>What's liturgical prayer? What are the biblical foundations for liturgical prayer? Let's take a look to in the Book of Revelation:</p><p><i>And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped God.</i>(Rev. 7, 11)</p><p><i>The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell down on to their faces and worshiped God.</i>(Rev. 11, 16)</p><p>The revelation shows us the form of worship that is in heaven vonstatten, namely the worship of the angels. Of this worship, we read that it consists only of praise and prostration.</p><p>After the Hebrews of the ministry of angels occurs in two forms: Greek to the service of God (.<i>mode</i>) And the service to the people (Greek.<i>diakonia</i>).<i>Are they not all ministering</i>(mode)<i>Spirits, sent forth to minister</i>(diakonia)<i>the sake of those who will inherit salvation?</i>(Hebrew 1, 14)</p><p>The Greek word<i>mode</i>refers to the service that the angels God do by worshiping Him. This is done by constantly repeating words. God is not interested in words, but in the heart (1 Samuel 16: 7).</p><p>The Greek word<i>diakonia</i>however, refers to the service that the angels aid to the people when they are sent by God, for example, to deliver a message. The words of this service are varied and specific, depending on the respective receivers and the concrete and particular circumstances.</p><p>The early church was based on this distinction. She loved to imitate the angels in their worship to the request in the Our Father to meet:<i>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.</i>They used the Book of Psalms it as a source for the worship of God in praise and fell down while praying the psalms to God and gave Him as the honor as the angels do it!</p><p><b>The psalms in the Egyptian desert and the Agpeya</b></p><p>In the 4th century formed in Egypt - among many worshipers who went as a hermit in the desert, to devote worship for their lives completely - two major groups of worshipers.</p><p>One of them in the area of ​​Wadi El Natrun in the north consisted of spiritually highly advanced worshipers. They prayed all the 150 psalms every day. You could spend many hours in prayer and prayed all day, according to the scripture: But I'm always in prayer (Psalm 109: 4), and faithful to the call of Jesus in Luke 18: 1, which says:<i>And he spoke also a parable to them that they should always pray and not faint.</i>The apostle Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians 5, 17:<i>Pray unceasingly!</i>The prayers they performed with fasting during their daily work.</p><p>The other group of faith beginners pagan origin gathered around the Holy Pachomius in the south. They prayed on a set of psalms daily. In a revelation an angel to Saint Pachomius had brought some instructions for his community. Among the rules he had received, was a selection of 75 psalms for daily prayer. These are the Psalms of "Agpeya" a psalm prayer book, which is still in the Coptic Church in use.</p><p>"Agpeya" is a Coptic Arabic word meaning "hours" because the 75 Psalms are among the seven canonical hours of prayer, following the word in Psalm 119: 164:<i>Seven times a day I praise you.</i>In the center of the seven canonical hours, the individual healing acts of Christ are.</p><p><b>The Psalm Prayer connects us day by day with the salvific action of Christ</b></p><p>The prayer meetings are arranged on the day that they remind the worshipers to the individual salvation acts:</p><ul><li>The<b>1 hour</b>(Sunrise) is related to the resurrection of Christ and the new life in Christ, for the resurrection happened in the early morning hours.</li><li>The<b>3rd hour</b>takes the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in his eyes, as the Scripture tells us that the Holy Spirit was poured out at the third hour of the disciples. At the beginning of the day, we need a new, fresh anointing in order to live in the Spirit.</li><li>The<b>6 hours</b>focus forward to the crucifixion, which happened after the signature in the sixth hour. We need the power of the cross to our desires that want to keep us in the course of the day to kill.</li><li>The<b>9 hours</b>is the hour of victory, in which Jesus gave up his spirit and said:<i>It's done</i>(John 19, 30). The selected psalms this hour are songs of worship and praise (Psalms 95-100). After the prayer of the sixth hour of looking at the crucified Christ Please help the worshiper experiences joy by these words of Jesus. You mean that the joy fulfilled the petitioner and his salvation is eternal. but they remind us: "Let us bring the tasks of the day to an end."</li><li>In the following, the<b>11th hour</b>(Sunset), Jesus was removed from the cross and should be buried with the criminals, according to the prophetic of Isaiah (Isa 53, 9). But Joseph of Arimathea intervened, took Jesus and laid Him in a new grave. In this hour of the dead body of Jesus was anointed with herbs and wrapped in linen. It is the hour in which we complete our day's work and begin to rest on our laurels.</li><li>The<b>12th hour</b>(Before sleep) is the hour, was placed in Jesus in the grave. This hour marks the end of the day and reminds us that our life may end at any moment. The early fathers like talking the end of her life in mind, because it helps to always keep the fear of God in their hearts. Nowadays we do not like to think of our hour of death. We think this is negative thinking. This has meant that we have lost the fear of God! The last hour heralds even sleep, sometimes also called "little death" is called. But the next morning, we are re-raised!</li><li>The last hour of prayer is the<b>midnight prayer</b>, The early church expected the second coming of Christ, the bridegroom, at midnight (Matthew 25: 6). That is why this subject in the center of the Psalms of the midnight prayer.</li></ul><p>Psalms each followed by a reading from the Gospels, which is related to the respective saving act. This reference is - as with the Psalms that specific hour - sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly. The Gospel passage of the prayer of the third hour, for example, is about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and thus is directly related to the focus of this prayer meeting. The reading of the sixth hour, however, is a passage from the Sermon on the Mount with the Beatitudes. She has apparently not related to the Crucifixion, the theme of this prayer meeting. But the Sermon on the Mount can be lived never, if not our ego is crucified with Christ.</p><p>The gospel section are brief prayer sections, the various early writings are taken. The early Fathers of the Church who lived in Wadi El Natrun and prayed the 150 Psalms every day, not reciting a psalm after another. Rather, they prayed some psalms and then paused to pray their own prayers. They left it to the leadership of the Holy Spirit, and they usually prayed with words of the Bible.</p><p>Some of these prayers of well-advanced in the spirit fathers were written by their students or memorized in order to use them in their own prayers. was compiled as the Agpeya for beginners, some passages were selected as guidance and help for them from these traditional prayers. Individual sections that were not initially included in the Agpeya were added in later centuries.</p><p>After these prayers the early Fathers implored God's mercy in prayer. They did this by praying 41 times, "Lord, have mercy" (Greek.<i>Lord, have mercy</i>). The number 41 is reminiscent of the Passion of Christ:<br></br>39 lashes plus the crown of thorns and the nails. The petitioner expressed the fact that Christ had to suffer for their sins. At the same time these sufferings were them to the source of their power and strength.</p><p>Because the "absolution" closes the completion of each hour a summary of. This word has a specific meaning. In 1 John 3: 8, we read:<i>The reason the Son of God has been revealed, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</i>The "destroy" with translated "resolve" and Greek word means or "disengage" (Latin<i>dissolve</i>). Of these, the word "absolution" is derived. It will say that everything is in praying with regard to sin, is resolved and resolved. With gratitude to the Lord to close the prayer.</p><p><b>Pray with the cross in his hand</b></p><p>The Fathers of the early Church loved to hold during the psalm prayer a cross in his hand. So they could express that the cross is the source of their redemption and salvation and their prayers would be in vain without the cross. They also wanted to honor the crucified in this way and thank Him. Your love for the cross they brought embodied in the fact that they kept the cross and kissed.</p><p><b>Prostration during prayer Psalm</b></p><p>After each Psalm the early Fathers fell on their face. The Hebrew word for "worship" in the OT (e.g., 1, Genesis 22, 5; 5, Moses 26, 10; Ps 86, 9) literally means to kneel down until the end contacts the ground. This is meant by "falling down".</p><p>According to the early fathers of this prostration is already in itself a complete worship, they attached great importance. Often they fell down many times just a few words of prayer.</p><p>The early Fathers looked the way during their prayers usually to the east, because they so much yearned for the second coming of Christ. This was based on their understanding of Matthew 24, 27. That does not mean that they necessarily to line up to when they pray every time to the east. They lived in the wealth of the freedom of spirit and were always sensitive to His guidance.</p><p><b>Means and not an end in itself</b></p><p>It is very important to consider the psalms always as a tool or means and does not become an end in itself. It is a way to be filled with the word of God. For the psalms combines three essential spiritual activities: prayer, recording of God's word and the falling down!</p><p><b>Practical tips for praying the Psalms</b></p><p>Praying the Psalms should be practiced slowly and internalized so that it can be an integral part of personal prayer life. It does not matter how many hours of prayer to pray one day in the course, but on the psalms to a daily practice will be to ensure that the words of the Psalms prayed live in us and bear fruit.</p><p>The Psalms with the still unfamiliar prayer is therefore recommended to first with<i>one</i>Until this prayer at a fixed and regular part of the day has become and to remain - to begin prayer time in the day - or even select only a few psalms from the question hour. Later may be channeled from the spirit and, best added taken according to the measure of grace that is given by God under the guidance of a spiritual father or spiritual mother more psalms and prayer times. That should never be rushed, so that the psalms does not affect damage. After the early Fathers of the Church everything is excessive by demons.</p><p>Similarly, the petitioner may feel quite free to leave the non-biblical sections in whole or in part aside. They speak the language and reflect the depth of the worship of the early Fathers to us where we encounter today abruptly, may seem at times strange.</p><p><b>Maria in der Agpeya</b></p><p>Some prayer sections and statements relating wholly or partly to the Virgin Mary, are set in this edition of Agpeya in italics. Worshipers who feel uncomfortable with these passages, they may skip.</p><p>The historical background of these passages is the Nestorian controversy at the beginning of the 5th century. Nestorius, at that time Patriarch of Constantinople Opel, claimed that Mary was not<i>theotokos</i>(Literally "God-bearer", now mostly "Mother of God"), but Christusgebärerin (<i>christotokos</i>), Mother of a man. The divinity of Christ have acquired during the course of his life (at baptism). In contrast, the biblical statement in Luke 1, 35:<i>The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you; it is also that holy thing which shall be born shall be called Son of God.</i>The Holy Spirit and the divinity was already on the womb of the Virgin Mary on these seeds of the incarnation. Jesus was and remained God when He was born a man. The ecumenical councils of Ephesus 431 n. Chr. Chalcedony and 451 n. Chr. Condemned Nestorianism as heresy. To counter the Nestorians and affirm Mary as Mother of God and honor their role was as<i>theotokos</i>highlighted by these councils. Therefore, the passages in question were Maria added the prayers of Agpeya.</p><p>That Fr. Macarius (Dr. Atef Meshreky)</p>
